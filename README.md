# garmin-connect-heart-rate-exporter

## gchrexport.py

A small python tool to export your (Vivosmart HR) heart rate data as json-File and FIT-File from the Garmin Connect page.
Code base from: https://github.com/kjkjava/garmin-connect-export

Attention: To be able to work, this program needs at least one activity stored in Garmin Connect. This is because it extracts the username from an activity.

## show_heart_rate.py

A small python tool to visualize your heart rate over a certain time period. Just as an example.

Hope it helps someone ;-)
